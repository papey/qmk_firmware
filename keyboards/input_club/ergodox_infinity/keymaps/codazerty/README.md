## Overview

### Programming key access

Easy access to all programming keys like (), {}, [], ;, = and much more

### Arrow keys

Arrow keys are mapped on hjkl for complete vi experience

### Symbols and accents keys

I'm too lazy to memorize Unicode char so a dedicated layer is used for
both accents and some symbols
